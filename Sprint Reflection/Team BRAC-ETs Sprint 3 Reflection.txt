Team BRAC-ETs Sprint 3 Reflection


Overall Performance
* Got base functionality of Sprint done
* Pushed some minor details, such as Star Mario animation, some Shell bugs, and Block/Item interactions to next Sprint
* In general, pretty pleased with the group's effort/completion on Sprint3


Constructive Changes
* The earlier In-Person meeting was a good move, especially to do it before a in-class code review
* The Team's Code Reviews were much better spaced/scheduled than last Sprint
* The team pay more attention on debugging/testing, the fuctions were more effective/stable than last Sprint
* While there will still miscommunications at times, we planned technical details of components more collaboratively in this sprint than the previous.  
* We had fewer formal meetings this sprint but were in pretty much constant contact on discord, which helped boost productivity
* We merged code more frequently
* We met in person much sooner which was helpful
* We got our code reviews done quicker
* Our outlines of code happened faster


Detrimental Changes
* Use of ZenHub was still very limited and not often updated
* Details of code were a bit murky and could made it difficult at points to connect code together
* Our testing was not the most ideal and could be much better, often took way too long during meetings
* Could still improve communication on technical details
* Didn't test enough
* Still some inconsistent comment structures
* Pushing debug statements into repo


Future Plans for Sprints
* Setup testing plans so we can better work out how to test our implementations
* Provide more/better comments in certain code areas as well as make sure everyone reads and agrees to interfaces and their wording
* During the process of testing, provide more/better comments of updates, and a file record these improvements in order
* Potentially do multiple shorter in person meetings
* Could meet even more in person
* Run code metrics more often
* Design through testing plan
