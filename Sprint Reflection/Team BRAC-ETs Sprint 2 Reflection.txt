Team BRAC-ETs Sprint 2 Reflection


Overall Performance
* Got base functionality of Sprint done
* Pushed collisions to next Sprint
* Bulk of our code review happened near end of sprint, we want to change this for future sprints, as it wasn’t as efficient as it could have been


Constructive Changes
* In-person meetings were more productive for us than our Zoom meetings
* Good communication through Discord


Detrimental Changes
* Waited too long to review code together
* Worked apart too much, could have combined code much earlier
* Waited too long for code reviews


Future Plans for Sprints
* More in-person meetings
* Better planning/designing
* Getting base/foundation of code down and reviewed before working on features
* Need to agree and decide on how to comment/structure code before we write more code
* Code reviews need to happen more regularly throughout sprint
* Use ZenHub more frequently, as the sprint went on it was updated less and less
* Actually stick with deadlines outlined
* More consistent pull requests on Github and combining our code a lot sooner
* Run code metrics in VS more often
