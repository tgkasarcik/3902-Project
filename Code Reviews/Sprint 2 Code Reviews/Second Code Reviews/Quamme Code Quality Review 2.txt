Comments:
* The block constructor takes a lot of parameters, I’m not sure if there’s anything we can do to shorten it
* I think the if/else branch in the constructor could be its own private method in the class so that there is less logic in the constructor itself
* Similarly the logic in reset could maybe be its own method that gets called in Reset, something like “GetNewUState”, I think this one is less critical than the constructor though
* I think the field names should be camelcase and not capitalized, to me it reads as confusing and like they are method names and not variables
* If a new block type got added we would have to make a lot of changes all over this class rather than just in one place
