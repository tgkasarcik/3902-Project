Code smell focused on:
Duplicated code
Too many parameters
Comments

Comments:
- Functions for applying in game changes accompanied with the enemy classes can be improved in simplicity. Koopa and Goombas' Update needs to have the code for getting/updating his Sprite as well with the current code. The update function should call sprites instead of calling sprite by different functions, such as Move and TakeDamage.
- The constructor is a little complicated and has too many parameters. It may help to reduce that by combining all the booleans used into a single object.
- Variables, are well named, decently readable, and make sense.
- GetHitBox function is a little unclear, the function could be better to have more comments. Furthermore, the GetHitBox function will be implemented eventually after the collision class is completed.
