Comments:
* I think the Update method in this class could use some comments to explain what it is doing. I am looking at it, and while I think the variable names are descriptive, it would be much easier to understand the logic with a few comments on what is being checked for and what it is doing in response.
* Collision just has a return in it, I think having a comment explaining that we have not yet implemented collisions in our project would help someone looking at this code for the first time understand this decision.
* I am slightly confused what the fall boolean does, I think a comment above the field could help.
* Overall, variable names provide clarity, I think the logic could be commented though
