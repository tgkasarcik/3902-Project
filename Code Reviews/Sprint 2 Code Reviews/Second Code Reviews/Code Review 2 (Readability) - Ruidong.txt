Code smell focused on:
Too many parameters
Comments

Comments:
- Method names are well named, there could have more Mario Transitions cases within spriteNames like “BigMarioToFire” and "SmallMarioToFire”.
- Clear type classification about Mario’s states, action and direction. These variable names make sense and are efficient.
- Comments in the file are clear and understandable for distinguishing different loaded content and different sprites.
- There could be more detailed comments about different sheets, which help build the content of the game.
- Both constructors are a little complicated and have too many parameters.
