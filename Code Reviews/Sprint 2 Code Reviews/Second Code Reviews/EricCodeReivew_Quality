Comments:
1. It needs to implement the IUpdateable interface
2. Having a Update method to update the states and sprites is necessary
3. Then it should update the sprite in different corresponding method. (eg. Update MoveShell sprite in Move method).
4. It also need to call Move() method in Update() method. If not it won't move automatically. In the future sprint, it should also call the
different methods for corresponding situation
5. Overall, It still needed to implement more.
