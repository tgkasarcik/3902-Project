Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Long Method
  -Dead Code
  -Inconsistent names
Comments:
  -"private bool isDrawn"
    -I believe this should be stored by the sprite
  -"XMoveState.Movement(FaceLeft)" 
    -should negate "FaceLeft"
    -"FaceLeft" should be in camel casing
  -Needs to implement "IGameObject"
  -"SpriteFactory" shoule be in camel casing
  -Using location and position is inconsistent naming conventions
  -Potentially too many parameters
    -Is there no base case for a Koopa?
  -Contructor parameter SpriteFactory sprite is inconsistent naming
    -SpriteFactory is not a sprite and could cause confusion with the Sprite property
    -Change to spriteFactory?
  -Needs to implement ICollideable
  
Change Test:
  Q. If the game allowed for Koopas to Jump would the class be able to support it
  A. I would think yes. A method would need to be added to tell the IYMove state that the koopa has jumped.
