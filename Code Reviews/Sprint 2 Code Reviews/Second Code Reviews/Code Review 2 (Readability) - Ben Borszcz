Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Long Method
  -Dead Code
  -Inconsistent names
Comments:
  Overall the code is well named and decently readable,
  the contructor is a little complicated and does contain
  alot of parameters. Would be good to have comments 
  explaining what some of the params in the contructor 
  exactly control. Would also be good to group together 
  properties at the top of the class.
