Comments:
1. the method is really short and clear.
2. the naming of the method and variable is clear enought that user can know what it is.
3. For the parameters in constructor of three states, the bool variable should have a variable name to let user know what it is
4. Overall, it is pretty clear method, but it need more detail more parameters in the constructor of states
