Comments:
  Overall, this file is pretty readable.  I don't notice any massive errors at first glance from this file.  Looking at code smells, this file is also pretty good.
  Firstly, there are no unnecessary literals in this file.  There also doesn't appear to be any duplicated code in this file.  Comments are one way this file could be
  improved, however.  Specifiically, I'd like to see some comments in the Update() method, because the code here is pretty complex and it's not necessarily obvious what
  it does at first glance.  On a related note, this method also has two nested if statments, which can cause conditional complexity.  Two nested ifs are not too bad, but
  could potentially be simplified.  This class does not appear to be longer than it needs to be.  The naming scheme here appears to be consistent.  This class is not a data
  class.  This class only has two public members, which is good.  My only suggestion would be to make the ISprite private, but I realize this may be declared on the
  ICollideable interface as of right now.  This class fully implements all of its inherited interfaces.  There are no methods in this class that are unnecessarily long.
  Overall, this class is quite readable and does not have too many glaring errors.
