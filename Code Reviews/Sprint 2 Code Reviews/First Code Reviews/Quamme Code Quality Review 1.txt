Comments:
* Background sprite comment at line 7 seems unnecessary.
* I don’t think it needs to implement IItem.
* If the object gets an ISprite object, then it shouldn’t need Columns, Rows, SourceRectangle, or Texture variables
* I don’t think this needs Mario’s position.
* What is graphics variable used for? It is never used.
* Right now the Draw method is commented out and the 2 other methods don’t do anything, so I’m not sure what this class is for.
* If implementing draw method, should implement IDrawable.
* Constructor takes too many parameters, this could make it difficult to test and call and makes it more likely to create bugs
