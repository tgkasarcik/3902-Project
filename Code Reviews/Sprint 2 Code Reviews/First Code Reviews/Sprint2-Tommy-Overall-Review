** I'm only going to provide comments on things I think can be improved.  To save space, I won't say anything if something looks good.  **

Overall Comments:
	-Every object that has a sprite should get a Vector2 containing its location passed to it in its constructor, which will be called inside of GameObjectManager.
	This ensures a single point of control over everything drawn to the screen.
	
	-We need to pick a consistent comment scheme for every file.  

	-With the new design, all game object classes (Mario, Koopa, Goomba, Block, Items) should implement IDrawable and have a private sprite.
	
	-All classes that need a reference to the SpriteFactory should put a parameter for it in their constructors.

Interfaces:
	IItem:
		-Implement IDrawable interface
		-Remove ISprite from interface
		
	IPlayer:
		-Implement IDrawable interface
		-Remove ISprite from interface
		
	IStructure:
		-Implement IDrawable interface
		-Remove ISprite from interface
		

Classes:
	Command Classes:
		SwitchingDrawingCommand:
			-Can't pass in a list of sprites with our current design; need to modify this.
			
	Enemies:
		Goomba:
			-Remove static access modifier from XMove, Health, YMove, Sprite; these should be instance variables since they will be different for each instance of the object
			
		Koopa:
			-Remove static access modifier from XMove, Health, YMove, Sprite; these should be instance variables since they will be different for each instance of the object
			
	Structure:
		Block:
			-ISprite should be private
			-Might want to consider making other variables private as well
			
		Note done yet
