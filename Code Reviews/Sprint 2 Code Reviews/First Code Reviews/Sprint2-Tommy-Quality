Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
Comments:
  Overall, this class is pretty solid from a code quality standpoint.  There is no excessive use of literals here which is good.  There is also no duplicated code.  
  There are no comments in this file; adding some would help future users use this class more easily.  There are no conditionals in this class, so therefore it is 
  fine on conditional complexity.  This class is not longer than it needs to be.  Your naming scheme for variables is consistent here.  As for the public properties
  in this class, I am not sure why there are two IStateMachine properties declared within the same name of StateMachine.  Maybe you meant to give them different names?
  In terms of the code smells I focused on, this class has no major issues.  
Suggested Change:
  One interesting thing I notice though, is that the Jump() method takes a GameTime parameter but does nothing with it.  Maybe the StateMachine interface needs to be 
  changed to support this parameter.
