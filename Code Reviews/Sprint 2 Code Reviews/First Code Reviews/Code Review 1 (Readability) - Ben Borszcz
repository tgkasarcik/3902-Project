Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Long Method
  -Dead Code
  -Inconsistent names
Comments:
  Overall the code is well named and decently readable.
  It has alot of good comments aswell for what things do.
  The only question I have is, why is the MOVEMOD all caps?
