Comments:
* The “state and draw interface” comment I don’t think is necessary and adds confusion
* Without commenting, the change direction method is a little unclear what it does
* Fall method unclear, what is falling to the bottom? Of the screen, or to a predefined point?
* GetPosition method comment I think over explains the method and makes the method less general than it could be
* Overall good variable names, comments could be added for further clarity
