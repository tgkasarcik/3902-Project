Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Long Method
  -Dead Code
  -Inconsistent names
Comments:
  -"private bool isDrawn"
    -I believe this should be stored by the sprite
  -IsDrawn() implemented incorrectly
  -DisableDrawing() implemented incorrectly
  -EnableDrawing() implemented incorrectly
  -Will this need an update()
 
Change Test:
  Q. If the game allowed for scrolling text would the class be able to support it.
  A. I would think yes. A method would need to be added to update and change location.
