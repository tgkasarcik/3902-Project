*** This is a redo of the first code review to replace it. This will be done on our code for things after we've finalized a majority of it for Sprint 2 ***

- The enum BlockType helps for both readability and code function to reduce the possibility of bugs.
- The constructor for Block is rather long. Might there be a way to reduce its length?
- In GetHitBox function, has Sprite.Texture.Bounds which has two dots to it. Verging on the side of going too deep and may affect readability.
- Overall, all functions make sense, are short and concise, and make sense. Having comments on some things may help provide clarity though.

- Comments provide good ideas about what the code is for/doing.
- Has magic numbers in its constructor and ThrowFireBall function which can cause confusion when looking back later. Make constants for them.
- The functions are short and have reasonable parameters.
- MOVEMOD is unused in this class. Where is it used? Why is it set and stored here?
- PickupPower may want to use a enum rather than string as a parameter as it will help with not having bugs in the code.
- gameTime.TotalGameTime.TotalSeconds is called twice here. Can be shortened a well as number of times called by updating a varaible that will store its value that can be referenced later when needed.
