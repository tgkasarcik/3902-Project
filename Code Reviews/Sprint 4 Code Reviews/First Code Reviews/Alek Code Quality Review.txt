----- Comments As Follows -----
- Last function, clear, should start with capital C, and the last bracket should be tabbed once more to the right to line up with top of function.
- All functions are simple and understandable, but comments could help explain further what each function is doing/supposed to do.
	- Not exactly sure what the AddFloor and AddLevel funtions are doing, comments might be able to help explain.
	- Comments on the variables at the top of the file would help too in understanding what they're meant to do.
		- Are any of them constants (Like KillGoomba_Score, KillKoopa_Score, etc.) and therefore can be made static?
- Reset function shouldn't be needed here. If a reset of the HUD is needed, then the game should just call to create a new HUD.
- No function has too many parameters nor has difficult to understand code or is too coupled. Everything is pretty cohesive.
