Comments:
* Indentation (at least in GitHub) is off, makes it difficult to read because like at line 73, the loop is indented behind the method it is in
* Do we need the CollisionObject/Rectangle classes? I guess I am just not sure what the purpose of them is, not saying it's wrong just a little confused on their purpose
* Should CollisionHandler even need to implement an interface?
