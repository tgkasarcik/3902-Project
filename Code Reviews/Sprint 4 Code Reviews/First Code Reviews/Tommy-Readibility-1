Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
Comments:
  Overall, the code in this class is pretty readible.  There is no execessive use of literals.  There is no duplicated code.  In the places where comments
  are present, they are good, but some methods do not have comments at all.  I would suggest adding at least one high level comment that explains the behavior
  of each method that is in this class.  There is no unnecessary conditional complexity.  This class is not larger than it needs to be.  All variables in this
  class are named consistently.  It is a minor detail, but in C#, private variables should always start with a lower case character by convention.  In this 
  class, however, all private variables start with an upper case character.  I suggest changing this to maintain a consistent style with the rest of the code
  base.  This class is not a data class.  There is no indecent exposure in this class.  There is no refuesed bequest in this class, as it does not implement
  an interface.  There are no unnecessarily long methods in this class.  Overall, the code in this class is highly readible, and can be made even more readible
  with a few slight modifications.  Good work!
