----- Comments As Follows -----
- Has a lot of separate boolean variables which makes reading a little tedious, can they be combined into one single variable or grouped together somehow?
- Comments are well written and make sense. Allow for quick understanding of a general section of code or a function overall.
- Names of variables and functions make reasonable sense.
- No functions have really large number of parameters.
- DrawScreens has lots of if statements with inner code being a single line. This could we compressed into single-line if-statements.
- Lots of magic numbers still. What do they all represent and can they be made into constants?
- Functions are all of reasonable and readable lengths.
