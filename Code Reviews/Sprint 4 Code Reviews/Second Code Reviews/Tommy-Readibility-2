Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
  Comments:
    Overall, this class is decently readible.  There are only a handful of literals present throughout, but they are in places that make sence, namely 
    in getting a Sprite from a set of 3 string keys.  There is a little bit of duplicated code in this class.  Namely, the DoAnimate() method is 
    declared twice and I can't quite tell why.  Is this a mistake?  Or is this intentional?  Comments are present throughout, which is helpful for
    readibility.  There is a bit of conditional complexity present in this class, but I believe that it is warranted given the job this class has.  
    This class is somewhat large, but I think its length is justified because it is responsible for executing many complex actions.  Variables are named
    consistently throughout.  This is not a data class.  There is no indecent exposure.  There is no refused bequest.  Some methods are a bit long, but
    again, they are all justified.  Overall, the code in this class is very readible.
