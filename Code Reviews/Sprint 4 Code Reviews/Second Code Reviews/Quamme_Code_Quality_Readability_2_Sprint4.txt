Comments:
* The name GetCoin does not seem indiciative of incrementing a coin, I think the name could be more clear
* Is AddFloor ever called?
* Overall set up well, seems straight forward and not overly complex. Easy to read through for the most part.
* Some duplicated code in DeathReset and GameOverReset and Constructor, could the duplicated parts be combined?
