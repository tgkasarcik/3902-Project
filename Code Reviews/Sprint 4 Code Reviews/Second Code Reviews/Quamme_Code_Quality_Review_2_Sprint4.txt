Comments:
* Fields all capitalized that aren't constants, should these be lower case?
* Do no_move and next_update_interval need to exist? From Kirby's notes it seems like 0 isn't a magic num.
* Nice commenting
* Line 35 is checking for double equality, which seems like it could be error-prone
* Some duplicated code
