Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
  Comments:
    Overall, the code in this class is of a very high quality.  There are no literals used throughout.  There is no duplicated code.  Some comments are 
    present, but more would further increase the quality of this code.  There are only a handful of if statements present throughout this file, and, 
    therefore, conditional complexity is not an issue.  This class does not appear to be any larger than it needs to be.  All variables are named consistently.
    This is not a data class.  There is no indecent exposure.  There is no refused bequest.  There are no methods that are longer than they need to be.  Overall,
    the code in this class is of a very high quality.  
    
  Suggestion:
    One suggestion I have for this class is to consdider adding a Physics object to it.  I suggest this because physics apply to debris objects just like any
    other objects.  This would probably make some of the calculations in this not be necessary.
