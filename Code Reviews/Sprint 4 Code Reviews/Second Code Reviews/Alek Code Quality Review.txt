----- Comments As Follows -----
- Readability is reasonably good.
- Indenting of brackets seems off for some reason.
- Some variable names are a bit vague, could use comments to explain them or renaming (Like type1 and type2 are rather vague)
- AddToDictionary calls are rather numerous. I believe it was stated that shese could be moved to a data file, but I'll restate it again here.
- Code seems rather clean otherwise with no out-of-place variables or calls to functions.
