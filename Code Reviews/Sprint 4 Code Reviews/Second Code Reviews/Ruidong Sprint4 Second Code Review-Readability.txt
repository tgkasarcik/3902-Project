Comments:
- Understandable AnimationEngine class name for updating location and interactions of Animation.
- The parameters are not too long for most functions, these method names are well named.
- we could have som parameters in function update to make it clear and simple, it is a little big.
- The AnimationEngine class is completed well, further implementation will focus on more Animation implementations related to Mario interaction.
- There are no replicate code.
