----- Comments As Follows -----
- The constructor has a rather lengthy line of parameters. Could it be possible to send in the masterlist and then pull each of the necessary lists out from in the constructor?
- currObject.GetHitBox().Intersects(...) and overlap.Center.X (or Y) have more than 1 "." to them which increases our coupling. Can we reduce the "."s possibly by making functions
  to provide those value better or make variables that hold one something like curObject.GetHitBox()?
- Comments provide good ideas as to what different parts of the code is doing or what they handle.
