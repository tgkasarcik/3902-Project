Comments:
- Function names are well named, Comments in the file are clear and understandable.
- should the function LoadLevel(int level) change the value sent to BackgroundObject to call the corresponding sprite? If so, it need to have a variable to represent the level. 
- there could have more files within function LoadFile, and more parameters within constructors.
