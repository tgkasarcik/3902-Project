Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
  Comments: 
    Overall, this file is pretty solid in terms of readibility.  There is no excessive use of literals.  There doesn't appear to be any duplicated code in the current state, 
    which may just be because it is not fully finished yet.  Comments are one way this file could be improved in terms of readibility.  Right now, I don't see any comments; 
    adding some breif comments would be beneficial to readibility.  This class does not have any conditional complexity currently.  This class is not a large class.  This 
    class dos not have inconsistent names, which is helpful for readibility.  This class is not a data class.  There are no public members in this class, so there is no 
    indecent exposure to external classes.  Currently, both methods of the IPhysics interface are not implemented, which I am assuming is just becuase the class is not finished.
    There are no long methods in this class.  Overall this file is very readible.
