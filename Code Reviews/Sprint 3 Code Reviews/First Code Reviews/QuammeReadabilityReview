Comments:
* Even after reading the comments, I am not sure what GetAllStates is used for and what it would return. What is obj and what is this in the method?
* For IStructureStateMachine, what would PerformAction do?
* How does throwing a fireball change the player's health state?
* Can enemies jump?
