1. Maybe it should have a string for detecting non collision for CollisionSide() or CheckForCollision() method, because if there is no block under mario and enemy, they will fall.
2. I am not sure do we need to call handle method in CheckForCollision() method? Or we should do that in the update method()in different object class.
