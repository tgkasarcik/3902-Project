- sprite.Texture.Bounds has too much coupling. We can solve by giving the sprite class a funtion for returning what info we need.
- Some of the calls for new states are given hard values of booleans (ture/false). This can be solved by giving the statemachine a function for providing the required states for
  a certain occasion.
- The Update function is a little long, but this can be shortened by reducing the number of calls to be made for updating states. And this can be changed with the use of a statemachine.
