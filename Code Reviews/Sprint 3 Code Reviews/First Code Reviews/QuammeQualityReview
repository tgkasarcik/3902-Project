Comments:
* Dead code left in at line 21, what is this for?
* Should fields be camelcase, not uppercase?
* I am not sure what the Get Rectangle method is for, right now it’s only returning a brand new rectangle. Should this be returning the object's location? Right now it is unclear.
* The 4 “.”’s used in “HState.GetType().Name.Contains” seem tightly coupled, is there a way to reduce this?
* Where does HState get set?
* I feel like we will need a more efficient way to handle the Update method, right now if we added new rooms this would just get exponentially longer and longer
