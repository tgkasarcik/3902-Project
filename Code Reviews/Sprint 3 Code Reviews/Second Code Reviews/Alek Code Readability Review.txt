----- Comments As Follows -----
- It might be a little confusing if the Direction enum and the ObjectType enum are in different places. Could we put both in the CollisionHandler Class or Interface together?
- The name Dictionary is very ambiguous here, I'm not sure eaxactly what it's holding just from its name.
	Based on the code, it looks like its a dictionary of commands for the collision happening, so a good name would be CollisionCommands or something like it.
- The indentation is really confusing, at least the way GitHub is presenting it.
- The Get(Custom)ObjectType functions seem really similar, are we able to combine them? I think a switch case could work well here.
- All the Add[GameObject]Collisions functions are large both length and width wise, this could be something a data file could store though.
	Could a data file work in place of this though?
- Although it is out of the CollisionHandler's class, the collision commands have some comments that I don't think make sense, like in GameObjectCollideBottomCommand, it mentions colliding in the x direction for a CollideY call.
- The whole class seems thoroughly done and names and uses seems cohesive enough, but there are some things that could use a bit more descriptiveness.
