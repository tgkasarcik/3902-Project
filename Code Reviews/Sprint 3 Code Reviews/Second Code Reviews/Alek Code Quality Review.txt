----- Comments As Follows -----
- Comments are well written and provide solid context for each function.
- Some functions have quite a few parmeters. Is there a chance that we could combine some into another single parameter to reduce line length and couple variables that should stay together?
- New Constructor has a LOT of parameters. I think this is one that we'll have to combine some parameters into a single parameter because the length here is much too long.
- Comment for New Constructor doesn't specify what is going on inside it too well. Is it possible to state what all the parameters would get used for? (Since there's quite a few)
- In the Update function, there is a portion of commented out code at the top, was this kept here as a fall back or reference or can it be removed?
- Overall, class has relatively simple and solid functions, but some comments on what each parameter is being used for could be helpful.
