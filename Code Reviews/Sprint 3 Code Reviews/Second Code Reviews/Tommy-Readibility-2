Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
Comments:
  This class has nicely readible code.  There is no excessive use of literals here.  There is no duplicated code here.  Comments are present throughout which helps
  boost readibility.  There is no unnecessary conditional complexity.  This class is somewhat long, but does not appear to be longer than it needs to be.  All
  variables are named according to a consistent scheme throughout, which also aids in readibility.  This is not a data class.  There are no public members in this
  class, so therefore it does not exhibit any indecent exposure.  This class does not implement an interface, so therefore it cannot exhibit refused bequest.  There
  are no overly long methods in this class.  Overall, for these reasons the code in this class is highly readible.
