Comments:
* Should Collision be implemented for this sprint?
* Same with GetHitBox, wouldn’t this need to be implemented for collision detection to work?
* Location is spelled wrong in Reset method
* Single line comments should be used consistently, sometimes they’re used at the end of the line and sometimes they’re used before the line
