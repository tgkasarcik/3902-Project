Comments:
* The indentation is off when I am viewing it through my GitHub (some methods have code that is to the left of the method)
* Would there be a way to have a data file with all the dictionary commands instead of having the code here?
* I am not sure this class needs an interface.
* For GetObjectType/GetCustomObjectType why is the variable object1 instead of just object? 1 to me implies there will be another one.
