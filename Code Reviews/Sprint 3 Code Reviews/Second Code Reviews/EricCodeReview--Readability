1. It looks so werid for the format, which is hard to find each method. Maybe it is the problem of space.
2. ExecuteCommand Method is really short, which can be combined into HandleCollision method.
3. About AddToDictionary method call in each Add[GameObject]Collisions, they are too long. Maybe we can declare a short variable for the long variable (eg. Left = Direction.LEFT)
4. GetObjectType() and GetCustomObjectType() looks similar, maybe it can be combined.
5. The whole class seems done, but it needs to change the format and simplify.
