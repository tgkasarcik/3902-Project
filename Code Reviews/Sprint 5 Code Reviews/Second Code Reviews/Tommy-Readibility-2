Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
Comments:
  Overall, the code in this class is pretty readible.  There is no excessive use of literals.  The only place they are used is with the GetSprite() method,
  which requires string paramaters so this is not an issue.  There does not appear to be any duplicated code.  Comments could be improved considerably in
  this class.  There are a lot of methods that have a giant line of statements to execute without a single comment explaining what is happening.  This code
  would be much easier to maintain if comments were added more frequently throughout to explain what is happening and why.  There is quite a bit of conditional
  complexity in this class.  Specifically, in the Update() method, there are up to 4 nested if statements in some spots.  This makes it quite hard to parse what
  is supposed to be happening as an outside reader.  Perhaps this logic could be simplified or refactored into helper methods.  This class is fairly large but 
  it has to perform some pretty complex behaviors, so that is not necessarily bad.  Naming is consistent throughout.  This is not a data class.  There is no 
  indecent exposure.  There is no refused bequest.  Most of the methods in this class are pretty long.  Again, they all have complex behaviors, so this is not
  bad in and of it self.  It is more of a problem in methods like GrabFlag() where there is a long line of statements without any comments or whitespace.  These
  methods could be improved by adding some whitespace around statements that work together.  Overall, this class is pretty strong in terms of readibiliy, but could
  be improved a bit.
