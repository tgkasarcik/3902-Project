Code Smells Focused on:
  -Excessive use of literals
  -Duplicated Code
  -Comments
  -Conditional Complexity
  -Large class
  -Inconsistent names
  -Data Class
  -Indecent Exposure
  -Refused Bequest
  -Long Method
  
Comments:
  There is no excessive use of literals.  There is no duplicated code.  Comments could be improved throughout.  There is a bit of conditional complexity.  
  Specifically, in Update() there is a fairly long chain of if/else statements.  This class is not bigger than it needs to be.  Naming is consistent.  This
  is not a data class.  There is no indecent exposure.  There is no refused bequest.  There are no overly long methods.  Overall, this code is of a pretty
  high quality. 
  
Suggestion:
  My only suggestion for this class is to simplify the Update method.  Right now, the logic seems a bit clunky.  It seems to me that it could be 
  simplified a bit.
