----- Comments As Follows -----
- The constructor requires quite a few parameters, the spritefactory parameter being one that is unneeded as the spritefactory is an instance class
- Could maybe use some comments specifying what some of the variables are used for, such as faceRight
- Some comments regarding the contents of the methods could be useful as well as they will help make the file nicer to read/skim through
- Functions are reasonable length
- No one function has an unreasonable number of parameters
- Comments on some parameters, like "isUp", could be useful as the name is very vague
