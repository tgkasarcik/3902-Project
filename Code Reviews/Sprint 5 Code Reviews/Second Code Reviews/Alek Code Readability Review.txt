----- Comments As Follows -----
- Really good comments stating what functions are doing
- Update method is a bit long, but also not overly complicated; can still understand what is going on with help from comments
- Names of variables and methods make sense and don't require much in terms of comments to explain what should be expected from them, but comments also still provide the extra info if needed
- There are misformated indentations that could be fixed, but nothing too serious
