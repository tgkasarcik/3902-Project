----- Comments As Follows -----
- Tabs for brackets don't look right and they don't match up. Maybe fix them and the code wuld be easier to read through.
- File is really long with tons of almost completely repetative function calls, could reduce their count by putting info into a data file for the dictionary of commands.
- Having comments to specify what each of the additions to the dictionary are for so that it might be easier to debug collisions.
- Length of file is mainly due to the AddXCollisions functions which cna be reduced by using a data file.
- Everything else is short and simple to look at.
- Having comments in/for functions might help someone who is first looking at it to more easily understand what's going on and follow the process.
