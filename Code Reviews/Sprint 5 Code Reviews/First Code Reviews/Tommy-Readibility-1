  Comments:
    The code in this class is quite readible.  There is no excessive use of literals.  There is no duplicated code.  While comments are sparce, most methods 
    in this class are pretty well self-documented, so it probably isn't a very big deal.  There is no excessive conditional complexity.  This class is not
    larger than it needs to be.  Naming is consistent throughout.  This is not a data class.  There is no refused bequest, since this class does not 
    implement an interface.  There does not appear to be any indecent exposure.  None of the methods in this class are overly long.  One confusing part of 
    this class is the broken method at the bottom.  Why is this here if its not implemented?  Overall, though, this class is quite readible.
