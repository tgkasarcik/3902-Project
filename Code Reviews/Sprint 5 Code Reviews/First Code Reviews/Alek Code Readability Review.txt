----- Comments As Follows -----
- Variable names make sense and give good idea as to what they're used for
- Comments on variables where confusion might be otherwise helps
- Some comments on the code throughout might be nice for the sake of understanding why it was coded the way it is
- Nothing is highly coupled through multiple "."s
- No function requiring an excessive amount of parameters
- No function is very long and they all remain relatively short and concise
