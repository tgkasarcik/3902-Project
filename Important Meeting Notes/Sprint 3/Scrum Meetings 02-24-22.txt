The following are summaries of things talked about during the meetings

1 PM - Alek, Catherine, Eric
	Crouch command in Mario
	PickupPower command and the string Parameter
	Would like feedback on Collision Detector Class and the new Command Classes
	Namespace is still Sprint2
	Strcuture statemachine - split into pipe, flag, and block statemachine

4:30 PM - Alek, Ben, Tommy, Eric
	Sprint2 name may change to another more general one
	Is the PerformAction function not something that belongs in the statemachine for blocks? - Involves adding items and coins to game
	Different machines for each type of structure, all blocks can be handled by one though
	Thinking more about the PerformAction function

9 PM - Alek, Catherine, Ruidong, Eric
	Move Power enum from InterativeQuestionBlock VState class to Mario class
	Add crouch functionality to Mario and his states
	Next Level/Previous level commands/functions?
	Plan to use some generic namespace title like CSE3902BRACKETS for namespace replacement
	XStates get a boolean value for BlockLeft and BlockRight to signal collisions with blocks to the left and/or right
	Add reference to GameObjectManager in BlockStateMachine to tell it to add a new item on the PerformAction function call?
	Shell class looks good, collision function needs to be changed/updated for handling the collisions when they occur
